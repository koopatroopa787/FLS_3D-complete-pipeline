## DATA FILES MOVED

The original PLY data files have been moved to:
`C:\Mill_Analysis_Project_DATA_BACKUP\`

This was done to reduce the project size for sharing (the files were ~2GB total).

### Original file locations:
- Reference: `data/reference/Mill body - vale verde - v1 (1).PLY` → `C:\Mill_Analysis_Project_DATA_BACKUP\reference\`
- Inner scan 1: `data/inner_scans/8_8-Aug-2024.ply` → `C:\Mill_Analysis_Project_DATA_BACKUP\inner_scans\`
- Inner scan 2: `data/inner_scans/3_18-Jan-2024.ply` → `C:\Mill_Analysis_Project_DATA_BACKUP\inner_scans\`

### To restore the data:
1. Copy files back from `C:\Mill_Analysis_Project_DATA_BACKUP\` to their original locations
2. Or update the file paths in `src/config.py` to point to the backup location

### File sizes moved:
- Reference file: ~8.8 MB
- Inner scan 1: ~1.0 GB
- Inner scan 2: ~995 MB
- **Total: ~2.0 GB**
